 tenet_religious_legal_roman_desc:0 "During the imperial period, Rome gradually elevated the monarchy to a new level. The Romans extended the tradition of posthumously honoring deceased rulers to living rulers. This not only promoted the strengthening of monarchy, but also laid the foundation for the later monotheistic concept. But being viewed as a demigod also meant that higher standards were set for the ruler's behavior."
