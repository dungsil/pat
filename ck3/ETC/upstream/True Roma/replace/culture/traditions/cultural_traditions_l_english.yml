 funditores_flavor:0 "Lightly armed slingers are not unique to the Roman Empire. Slingers have been powerful ranged units since ancient times, and the Empire's field troops have brought the slinger's ability to its full potential."
 legionarii_flavor:0 "The legionary runs through the entire history of the Roman Empire. After many reforms, when the eastern part gradually turned to cavalry tactics, the legionary was still the main force of the infantry-focused Western Empire."
 palatina_flavor:0 "The Roman Palace Guard originated from Diocletian's military reforms. It focused on protecting the direct military forces of the empire's rulers and was often used as a backup main force. Therefore, it was also called the Central Army."
 baaallistarii_flavor:0 "The Ravenna Crossbowman is the strongest ranged infantry of the Roman Empire. The pulley crossbow they use is also a high-level achievement of the empire's military technology. It is known as a ballista in the hand."
